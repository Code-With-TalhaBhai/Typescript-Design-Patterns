Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibili-
ties between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes
but also the patterns of communication between them. These patterns characterize
complex control flow that's difficult to follow at run-time. They shift your focus away
from flow of control to let you concentrate just on the way objects are interconnected.
Behavioral class patterns use inheritance to distribute behavior between classes.
