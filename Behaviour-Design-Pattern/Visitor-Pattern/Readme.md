Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements
on which it operates.


The Visitor design pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new operations or behaviors to a group of classes without modifying their structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a hierarchy of classes and want to perform different operations on those classes without altering their individual implementations.
